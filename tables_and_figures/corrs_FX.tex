\caption{Posterior medians of sample correlations 
             between three proxies for the market volatility and
             the preference for high-frequency model for
             2020/01/02 to 2023/01/31 out-of-sample period ($K=797$ observations).
             The proxies for the market volatility are: average standardized 
             realized volatility (avrg RV), 
             equally weighted market portfolio realized volatility (Mkt:eql) 
             and VIX index. The preference for the high-frequency model is measured as a 
             high-frequency 
             component weight in various  pooling schemes 
             as well as the difference between the daily log likelihood (logLik diff) 
             between the CAW and DCC-t models.}
