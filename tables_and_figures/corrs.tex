\caption{Posterior medians of sample correlations 
             between the preference for high-frequency
             model  and four proxies for the   market volatility for 
             2009/01/02-2009/12/31 out-of-sample period ($K=252$ observations).
             The preference for the high-frequency model is measured as a 
             high-frequency 
             component weight in various  pooling schemes 
             as well as the difference between the daily log likelihood (diff:logLik) 
             between the AIW and DCC-t models.
             The proxies for the market volatility are: average standardized 
             realized volatility (avrg RV), 
             equally weighted market portfolio realized volatility (Mkt:eql), 
             MCap weighted market portfolio realized volaltity (Mkt:MCap) 
             and VIX index.}
